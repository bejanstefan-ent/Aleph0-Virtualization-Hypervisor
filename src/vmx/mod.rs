//! VMX (Intel VT-x) support detection.
//!
//! Checking whether the CPU can enter VMX operation requires three
//! independent checks, each gated behind its own stub below:
//!
//! 1. [`cpuid::is_vmx_supported`] — CPUID.1:ECX.VMX\[bit 5\] is set.
//! 2. [`msr::feature_control_vmx_enabled`] — IA32_FEATURE_CONTROL MSR
//!    (0x3A) has the lock bit set and the "VMX outside SMX" bit set.
//! 3. [`detect`] — combines the two checks above into the single entry
//!    point the rest of the hypervisor should call.
//!
//! The CPUID check must run before the MSR check: IA32_FEATURE_CONTROL is
//! only guaranteed to exist on CPUs that support VMX or SMX, so reading it
//! on a CPU that doesn't (per CPUID) risks a #GP with no exception handler
//! installed yet.
