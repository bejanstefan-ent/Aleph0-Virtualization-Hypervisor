//! Reading the CPU's segmentation state.
//!
//! Long mode barely uses segmentation — most bases are 0 and limits are
//! ignored — but the registers still exist, and VM entry checks the values
//! written into the VMCS for both host and guest. So the state has to be read
//! out of the running CPU and copied in.
//!
//! Three kinds of value are needed per segment:
//!
//! * the **selector** — an index into the GDT, held in CS/SS/DS/ES/FS/GS/TR;
//! * the **base** — the real 64-bit start address. Only FS, GS and TR matter
//!   in long mode; the rest are architecturally 0.
//! * the **limit** and **access rights** — needed for guest state, not for
//!   host state. They are decoded from the segment's GDT descriptor by
//!   [`descriptor_limit`] and [`descriptor_access_rights`].
//!
//! Host state has two extra rules the CPU enforces at VM entry, both common
//! causes of "invalid host state" (error 8):
//!
//! * every host selector must have its RPL and TI bits (the low 3) clear;
//! * the host TR selector must not be 0 — it has to point at a real TSS.
//!
//! Nothing here needs VMX, so [`read_all`] can be called and printed under
//! plain QEMU/TCG to sanity-check the values before any VMCS work.
