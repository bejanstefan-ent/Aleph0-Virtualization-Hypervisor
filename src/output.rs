//! Where output may go, and what happens when the hypervisor panics.
//!
//! # Why Aleph0 has its own panic handler
//!
//! The `uefi` crate's handler (its `panic_handler` feature) prints with
//! `uefi::println!`, then calls `boot::stall` and `runtime::reset`: three
//! firmware calls. A panic inside the VM-exit handler would then enter
//! firmware from exit context, where interrupts are off and the firmware's
//! state is whatever the guest left behind. After `ExitBootServices` the
//! message would be lost entirely.
//!
//! This handler prints over serial first (no firmware needed), then on the
//! console, then halts the CPU. It never stalls, resets, or otherwise calls
//! into firmware.
//!
//! Host unit tests link `std`, which brings its own panic handler; two would
//! not link, so the handler and its state are compiled out under `cfg(test)`.

///   non-maskable events wake it: NMI, SMI, machine check, INIT/reset.
/// * After an NMI handler returns, execution continues after `HLT`; the loop
///   sends it straight back to `CLI; HLT`.
