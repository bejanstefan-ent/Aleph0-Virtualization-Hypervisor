//! A read-only walk of the current 4-level page tables.
//!
//! Answers one question: for a given address, what do the page tables say
//! about it? Is it mapped, can it be written, can code run from it?
//!
//! With EPT off and guest CR3 = host CR3, the guest translates addresses
//! through exactly these tables, so what they say about a page is what the
//! guest gets.
//!
//! In 64-bit mode the CPU translates every address through 4 levels of
//! tables, splitting the address into pieces:
//!
//! ```text
//!  47      39 38      30 29      21 20      12 11         0
//! [ PML4 idx | PDPT idx |  PD idx  |  PT idx  |   offset   ]
//!    9 bits     9 bits     9 bits     9 bits     12 bits
//! ```
//!
//! CR3 points to the first table (PML4). Each index picks one 8-byte entry
//! in the current table, and that entry points to the next table. The last
//! entry points to the page itself, and the offset is added to it.
//!
//! [`walk`] is pure logic over a "read the entry at this physical address"
//! function, so it can be tested on the host with fake tables.
//! [`walk_current`] runs it on the live CR3.
//!
//! A longer walkthrough with more examples is in `docs/PAGE_TABLE_WALK.md`.
//!
//! # Why the pieces are 12 and 9 bits
//!
//! A page is 4096 = 2^12 bytes, so 12 bits pick a byte inside it. A table
//! fills exactly one page with 8-byte entries: 4096 / 8 = 512 = 2^9
//! entries, so 9 bits pick an entry. 4 * 9 + 12 = 48 bits; bits 63:48 of
//! the address must be copies of bit 47 ("canonical").
//!
//! # The levels
//!
//! The names are historical: 32-bit x86 had only PD -> PT, and each wider
//! mode added a level on top. An entry is named after its table: PML4E,
//! PDPTE, PDE, PTE.
//!
//! ```text
//! CR3 ──► PML4  Page Map Level 4             one entry covers 512 GiB
//!          │
//!          ▼
//!         PDPT  Page Directory Pointer Table one entry covers   1 GiB ──(PS=1)──► 1 GiB page
//!          │
//!          ▼
//!         PD    Page Directory               one entry covers   2 MiB ──(PS=1)──► 2 MiB page
//!          │
//!          ▼
//!         PT    Page Table                   one entry covers   4 KiB = the page
//! ```
//!
//! Each level splits its region into 512 pieces. The tree only needs tables
//! for regions that are actually used: an unused 512 GiB region is just a
//! PML4 entry with P = 0. A flat table for 48 bits would itself be 512 GiB.
//!
//! At every level, two different things decide where to look:
//! - *which row* comes from the virtual address (that level's 9 bits);
//! - *where the table is* comes from the row read one level up (or CR3).
//!
//! # CR3
//!
//! One register per CPU core, holding the root of the tree in use right
//! now. It does not change per address: every lookup starts from the same
//! CR3 and only takes different rows. An OS gives each process its own tree
//! and loads that process's CR3 on a switch; VM entry/exit load GUEST_CR3 /
//! HOST_CR3 from the VMCS. Aleph0 never writes CR3: the UEFI firmware built
//! the (identity-mapped) tables and loaded CR3 before the `.efi` started.
//!
//! ```text
//!  63      52 51                     12 11     5  4   3  2  0
//! ┌──────────┬─────────────────────────┬────────┬───┬───┬────┐
//! │ reserved │  PML4 table address     │ ignored│PCD│PWT│ign │
//! └──────────┴─────────────────────────┴────────┴───┴───┴────┘
//! ```
//!
//! The low 12 address bits are always 0 (tables are 4 KiB-aligned), so they
//! are not stored. With CR4.PCIDE = 1, bits 11:0 hold a process-context ID.
//!
//! # Entry format
//!
//! Every entry is one 64-bit number: an address plus flag bits. `*` marks
//! the bits [`walk`] reads.
//!
//! An entry that points to the next table (any PML4E; PDPTE/PDE with PS=0):
//!

//!
//! A PTE (4 KiB page):
//!
//! ```text

//!
//! A PDE with PS = 1 (2 MiB page) looks like a PTE, except bit 7 is PS = 1,
//! PAT moves to bit 12, bits 20:13 are reserved (0), and the page address is
//! bits 51:21. A PDPTE with PS = 1 (1 GiB page) is the same with the page
//! address in bits 51:30 and bits 29:13 reserved.
//!
//! | Bit     | Name | Meaning                                                    |

//! | 2       | U/S  | User (ring 3) may access. 0 = kernel only.                 |
//! | 3, 4    | PWT, PCD | Caching: write-through, cache-disable.                 |
//! | 5       | A    | Accessed; set by the CPU when the entry is used.           |
//! | 6       | D    | Dirty (page entries only); set when the page is written.   |
//! | 7       | PS   | In PDPTE/PDE: 1 = this entry is a 1 GiB/2 MiB page.        |
//! | 7 or 12 | PAT  | Memory type (bit 7 in a PTE, bit 12 in a large page).      |
//! | 8       | G    | Global: keep in the TLB across CR3 changes (pages only).   |
//! | 51:12   | addr | Next table or page. Bits above MAXPHYADDR must be 0.       |
//! | 62:59   | PKey | Protection key (pages only); unused here.                  |
//! | 63      | XD   | No instruction fetch in this region (if EFER.NXE = 1).     |
//!
//! # Combining permissions
//!
//! The CPU checks every level and the strictest one wins, like doors in a
//! row: a page is writable only if R/W = 1 at *every* level (AND), and one
//! XD = 1 at *any* level blocks execution (OR). A PTE saying "writable"
//! under a read-only PDE is read-only.
//!
//! U/S works like R/W: a page is a *user* page only if U/S = 1 at every
//! level (AND); one U/S = 0 makes it a *supervisor* page. That matters even
//! for ring-0 code, through two CR4 bits:
//! - SMEP (bit 20): ring 0 may not *execute* from user pages.
//! - SMAP (bit 21): ring 0 may not *read or write* user pages unless
//!   RFLAGS.AC = 1.
//!
//! So for a ring-0 guest, "XD clear" alone does not prove a page is
//! executable, and "R/W set" alone does not prove it is writable.
//!
//! The CPU caches finished lookups in the TLB, so it does not walk on every
//! access; writing CR3 flushes most of that cache.
//!
//! # Worked example: the guest code page on Hyper-V
//!
//! Table locations and entry values are illustrative; the result matches
//! the Hyper-V log (`phys=0x7eb19000 size=Size4K writable=true xd=false`).
//!
//! ```text
//! virtual_address = 0x7eb19000
//!   47:39 = 000000000  PML4 index 0
//!   38:30 = 000000001  PDPT index 1
//!   29:21 = 111110101  PD   index 0x1F5
//!   20:12 = 100011001  PT   index 0x119
//!   11:0  = 0          offset 0
//!
//! CR3 = 0x7f801000                      -> table 0x7f801000
//! L4: row 0     at 0x7f801000 = 0x7f802023  P R/W A, PS=0 -> table 0x7f802000
//! L3: row 1     at 0x7f802008 = 0x7f803023  P R/W A, PS=0 -> table 0x7f803000
//! L2: row 0x1F5 at 0x7f803fa8 = 0x7f9a0023  P R/W A, PS=0 -> table 0x7f9a0000
//! L1: row 0x119 at 0x7f9a08c8 = 0x7eb19063  P R/W A D     -> page  0x7eb19000
//!
//! physical = 0x7eb19000 | (0x7eb19000 & 0xFFF) = 0x7eb19000
//! ```
//!
//! Each row address is `table + index * 8`; each next table is
//! `entry & ADDRESS_MASK`. The low bits `0x023` = `0b0010_0011` are P, R/W
//! and A; `0x063` adds D.
//!
//! Had the PD row been `0x7ea000E3` (`0xE3` sets PS), the walk would stop
//! at level 2 with a 2 MiB page and a 21-bit offset: physical =
//! `0x7ea00000 | (0x7eb19000 & 0x1FFFFF)` = the same `0x7eb19000`. The PT
//! index bits simply become part of the offset.
