//! Guest state for the first VM entry.
//!
//! On VMLAUNCH the CPU loads the guest's registers from the VMCS guest-state
//! fields, checks them, and starts executing at GUEST_RIP. Every register the
//! guest will have must therefore be written here first.
//!
//! The simplest valid 64-bit state is a copy of what the host CPU is running
//! with right now, since that state demonstrably works:
//!
//! | Guest field                  | Value                                     |
//! |------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
//! | RIP, RSP                     | the guest code page and guest stack top   |
//! | RFLAGS                       | `0x2`: only the always-1 bit; IF = 0, AC = 0 |
//! | CR0, CR3, CR4                | the host's (same page tables, same modes) |
//! | CS, SS, DS, ES, FS, GS, TR   | the host's selectors, decoded from the GDT |
//! | LDTR                         | unusable (UEFI does not use an LDT)       |
//! | GDTR, IDTR                   | the host's tables                         |
//! | SYSENTER MSRs                | the host's                                |
//! | DR7, IA32_DEBUGCTL           | `0x400` (reset value), `0`                |
//! | PAT, EFER                    | the host's, only if the entry controls load them |
//! | VMCS link pointer            | all ones: no shadow VMCS                  |
//! | activity, interruptibility, pending debug exceptions | `0`: running, nothing blocked |
//!
//! Without the "load IA32_EFER" entry control, the guest keeps the CPU's
//! current EFER, with LMA/LME set from the "IA-32e mode guest" control. So
//! the guest gets the host's EFER.NXE either way, which the shared page
//! tables need (see [`super::paging`]).
//!
//! The guest shares the host's GDT, IDT, TSS and page tables. That is fine
//! for a guest that only runs `mov; vmcall`, but it is not isolation.
//!
//! [`GuestState::write`] reads every field back after writing it. As with
//! the host fields, that proves storage only: the CPU checks the state when
//! VMLAUNCH runs, and reports a bad guest state as exit reason 33.
//! [`check_segments`] catches the two mistakes most likely to cause that.
