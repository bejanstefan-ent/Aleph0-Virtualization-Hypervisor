//! Firmware-independent debug output over the COM1 serial port.
//!
//! Further reading, kept in the repository so it is not forgotten:
//!
//! * `docs/SERIAL_LOGGING.md`: a beginner walkthrough of this file. Its
//!   step numbers match the `Step N` comments below.
//! * `docs/PORT_IO.md`: how `in`/`out` and the 16-bit I/O port space work,
//!   and how a hypervisor intercepts them.
//!
//! # Why not `uefi::println!`?
//!
//! `uefi::println!` calls the firmware's console driver. That is fine in
//! `main`, but this hypervisor will soon print from places where calling
//! firmware is unsafe or impossible:
//!
//! * the VM-exit handler, which runs with interrupts off, on its own stack,
//!   in the middle of whatever the firmware was doing when the guest started;
//! * anything after `ExitBootServices`, when the firmware console is gone.
//!
//! This module drives the serial hardware directly with `in`/`out`
//! instructions. It needs no allocator, no firmware, no interrupts and no
//! locks, so it works in every one of those contexts. Every VMM (QEMU,
//! Hyper-V, VMware, Bochs) emulates this device, which is why it is the
//! standard debug channel for OS and hypervisor work.
//!
//! # The device: a 16550 UART
//!
//! A UART turns bytes into a bit stream on a wire. The PC-compatible one sits
//! at I/O port base `0x3F8` (COM1) and exposes eight byte-wide registers at
//! `base + 0` through `base + 7`.
//!
//! # Port I/O in short
//!
//! x86 has two address spaces. Memory is reached with ordinary instructions
//! (`mov`). The **I/O space** is separate and **16 bits wide**: port numbers
//! run from `0x0000` to `0xFFFF` (65,536 ports, one byte each), and only the
//! `in`/`out` instructions reach it. Port `0x3F8` and memory address `0x3F8`
//! are unrelated.
//!
//! * `out dx, al` sends the byte in AL to the port numbered by DX;
//!   `in al, dx` reads a byte from port DX into AL.
//! * The port must be in DX here: the other form, with the port written
//!   into the instruction, only reaches ports `0x00`–`0xFF`, and COM1 is
//!   above that.
//! * Data can be 8, 16 or 32 bits (AL, AX, EAX). The UART's registers are
//!   all 8-bit, so this file only uses byte access ([`outb`], [`inb`]).
//! * The CPU sends the access to the chipset as an I/O transaction, and the
//!   device that claims that port answers. No device means a read of `0xFF`.
//! * Ports are not memory: a read can change device state, and writing and
//!   reading the same port can reach two different registers.
//! * Ring 0 may use any port; this code always runs at ring 0.
//!
//! Under Hyper-V, every `in`/`out` here causes a VM exit (reason 30) and
//! Hyper-V's emulated UART answers. Details: `docs/PORT_IO.md`.
//!
//! The registers used here, by offset from the base:
//!
//! | Offset | DLAB=0 (normal)         | DLAB=1 (setup)          |
//! |--------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
//! | 0      | transmit/receive byte   | divisor latch, low byte |
//! | 1      | interrupt enable        | divisor latch, high byte|
//! | 2      | FIFO control (write)    |                         |
//! | 3      | line control; bit 7 is DLAB                       |
//! | 4      | modem control; bit 4 is loopback                  |
//! | 5      | line status; bit 5 = ready for another byte       |
//!
//! DLAB ("divisor latch access bit") reuses offsets 0 and 1 for the baud
//! divisor while it is set. The UART clock runs at 115200 × 16 Hz, so the
//! divisor is `115200 / baud`; 1 selects the maximum, 115200 baud. Virtual
//! UARTs ignore the speed entirely, but real ones and terminal software
//! expect the usual "115200 8N1": 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit.
//!
//! # Sending a byte
//!
//! Poll line status bit 5 ("transmit holding register empty") until it is
//! set, then write the byte to offset 0. That is all [`write_byte`] does. The
//! poll is bounded, so a missing or wedged UART slows output down instead
//! of hanging the hypervisor.
//!
//! # Seeing the output
//!
//! * QEMU: `run.ps1` passes `-serial stdio`, so output appears in the
//!   terminal. OVMF also mirrors its own console to COM1, so lines printed
//!   with `log!` in `main` show up twice there: once from OVMF, once from
//!   this module.
//! * Hyper-V: `run-hyperv.ps1` attaches COM1 to a named pipe and reads it;
//!   see that script and the README.
//!
//! # Concurrency
//!
//! There is no lock. That is sound while exactly one CPU runs this code and
//! nothing interrupts a print with another print: true today, because the
//! exit handler runs with interrupts off and only between guest instructions.
//! Once several vCPUs exist, output needs a spinlock (not one that can
//! deadlock if an exit handler interrupts its own holder).
