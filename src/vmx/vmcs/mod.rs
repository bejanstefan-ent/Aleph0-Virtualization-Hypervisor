//! The Virtual Machine Control Structure (VMCS).
//!
//! A VMCS describes one virtual CPU: the guest's register state, the host
//! state to return to on a VM exit, and which events cause those exits.
//! One VMCS per vCPU; one "current" VMCS per logical processor.
//!
//! The region looks exactly like the VMXON region — 4 KiB, 4 KiB-aligned,
//! revision identifier in the first four bytes — but it is used differently.
//! Apart from that revision identifier, **never touch it with ordinary loads
//! and stores**: the internal layout is undocumented and the CPU caches
//! fields internally. [`vmread`] and [`vmwrite`] are the only legal access.
//!
//! Lifecycle:
//!
//! 1. [`VmcsRegion::allocate`] + [`VmcsRegion::write_revision_id`] — same as
//!    the VMXON region.
//! 2. [`VmcsRegion::vmclear`] — initialise it and flush any cached data the
//!    CPU holds for that physical address. Required once before first use,
//!    even on a freshly zeroed page.
//! 3. [`VmcsRegion::vmptrld`] — make it the *current* VMCS. From here on
//!    [`vmread`]/[`vmwrite`] act on it implicitly, with no address operand.
//! 4. [`vmwrite`] the fields, then [`launch`] (VMLAUNCH).
//!
//! [`VmcsRegion::create_current`] runs steps 1-3.
//!
//! Fields are addressed by a 32-bit **encoding**, not by an offset. The
//! encoding packs the field's width, type (control / read-only / guest /
//! host) and index; every encoding this hypervisor uses is in [`fields`].
//!
//! Like VMXON, these instructions report failure through RFLAGS rather than
//! exceptions: CF=1 is VMfailInvalid, ZF=1 is VMfailValid. The difference is
//! that once a current VMCS exists, VMfailValid also stores a numeric reason
//! readable via [`vm_instruction_error`].
